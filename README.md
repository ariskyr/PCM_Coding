# Pulse-code modulation Implementation in MATLAB

simple project to learn how PCM Encoding works. Implements the non uniform quantization
algorithm Lloyd-Max and also a generalised version of it using kmeans.

Details about the project can be found in the report.pdf which is written in greek
## Executing Program

Code written in Matlab, version 2021b. 

algorithms for a normal distribution source can be run from the runfilePCMA.m 
algorithm for an AR(5) auto regressive model can be run from the runfilePCMB.m
